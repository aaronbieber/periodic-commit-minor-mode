;;; Commentary:

;; Description:
;;
;; Periodic Commit Minor Mode is a simple tool for automatically
;; committing all changes to a Git repository periodically.  This might be
;; useful if, for example, you use a local Git repository as a safeguard
;; against unwanted data loss or corruption within files that are not
;; part of a project that changes in a predictable, atomic manner (like a
;; software project does).
;;
;; I store all of my Org Mode notes in Dropbox, but if I were to
;; accidentally delete a file's contents, Dropbox would happily sync
;; that with all of my other devices and I would lose that data
;; permanently.  Therefore, using Git locally, within Dropbox, is a
;; nice way to hedge against that possibility.
;;
;; Periodic Commit Minor Mode, when activated, will create an
;; automatic commit of all changes within the current file's
;; repository when:
;;
;; 1. The file is saved, and
;; 2. It has been greater than `pcmm-commit-frequency' since the last commit.
;;
;; The default commit frequency is 30 minutes.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; To use Periodic Commit Minor Mode, simply activate it in a buffer
;; that is a part of some repository that you wish to commit to.
;;
;; There are a couple of customizable options, which you can configure
;; through the `customize' facility by running
;; `M-x customize-group RET pcmm RET'.
